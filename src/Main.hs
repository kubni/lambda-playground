-- name parses the alphanumeric string

-- Here is what I think the return line in the abs parser is doing:
-- Lets say that we had \x y z.x+y+z
-- names = [x, y, z]
-- Then, we partially apply Abs constructor by passing names to it, so we have [Abs x _, Abs y _, Abs z _]
-- We use a fold to apply dot operator to those constructors, practically nesting them:
   --      Abs "x" . Abs "y" . Abs "z"
   -- which is a function equivalent to this:
   --  \e -> Abs "x" (Abs "y" (Abs "z" e))
-- At the end we just lift that into a Parsec monad type, while the <?> is there for errors, when our parser fails and doesn't consume anything


-- chainl1 uses (pure App) as an operator, and the result of (nonApp <* spaces) as a operands.
-- If (nonApp <* spaces parses 2 Abs-es, chainl1 will create App Abs1 Abs2)
-- TODO: Blog mentions App not being in expr because of a potentional infinite loop? How does that happen?
